## Oil Spill Detection

This project applies computer vision techniques for detecting oil spills in SAR images using PyTorch.  
Key steps in the project:
- Thresholding applied to highlight regions of interest.
- Masking techniques used for better focus on oil spill areas.
- Integration of PyTorch for model development and analysis.
