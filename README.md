# Deep Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of deep learning and computer vision projects organized into three main categories:

- **DeepLearning**: Projects related to deep learning models.
- **OpenCV**: Projects involving computer vision using OpenCV.
- **TransferLearning**: Projects leveraging transfer learning with pre-trained models.

## Project Index

### 2. **OpenCV**
- **Oil Spill Detection on SAR Images**  
  Detecting oil spills in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using image classification techniques with OpenCV.
  
- **Real-Time Object Detection using YOLO**  
  Real-time object detection from webcam or video streams using the YOLO model in OpenCV.

### 3. **TransferLearning**
- **Research Paper Summarizer using T5**
