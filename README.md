# Deep Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains various deep learning and computer vision projects organized into three main folders:

- **DeepLearning**: Projects related to deep learning models and training.
- **OpenCV**: Projects related to computer vision tasks.
- **TransferLearning**: Projects that utilize transfer learning to fine-tune pre-trained models.

## Projects Overview

### 1. DeepLearning - **VGG PyTorch for Pneumonia Detection**
This project uses the VGG model in PyTorch for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

- **Model**: VGG16
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Task**: Binary classification (Pneumonia vs. Normal)

### 2. OpenCV - **Oil Spill Detection on SAR Images**
This project focuses on detecting oil spills in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images.

- **Task**: Image classification for oil spill detection.
- **Framework**: OpenCV

### 3. OpenCV - **Real-Time Object Detection using YOLO**
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model.

- **Task**: Real-time object detection from video stream or webcam using YOLO.
- **Framework**: OpenCV, YOLO
- **Pre-trained Model**: YOLO weights and configuration files.

### 4. TransferLearning - **Research Paper Summarizer using T5 (Fine-Tuning)**
This project fine-tunes a T5 base model to summarize research papers.
